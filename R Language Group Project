# Introduction & Background

Plenty of research regarding sleep has been conducted throughout the decades. Typically, the research falls within the context of the importance of sleep, the factors affecting sleep and the cause & effect of sleep deprivation. Base on Naito et al. (2021) research paper, the paper highlights the basic statistical aspect of sleep deprivation among the undergraduate student in Malaysia with a sample size of 1132 participants. The paper returned stating that 58.1% of the participants responded with sleep deprivation. Furthermore, the paper found that the people living within the Asian region typically sleep 6 hours 30 minutes. On average, a difference of 1 hours 30 minute sleep deprivation (Recommended Sleep: 8 hours). The repercussion typically affect the individual person cognitive performance, emotional state, reaction speed and excessive daytime sleepiness (Cardoso 2018; Costa et al. 2022). Thereby suggesting a significant deterioration of the individual well being and overall performance. To emphasize the ramification of sleep deprivation, Ellenbogen (2005) paper highlights that the sample made 36% more error when sleep deprived.

## Problem Statement

1. From a user-centric perspective, the current measurement metric to evaluate sleep quality does not provide any added value to users. Thus, the project aims to research an alternate measurement metric to quantify sleep quality which is sleep efficiency.

## Research Objective

1. Explore and identify which factors have significant influences on sleep efficiency. 
\newline
2. Explore if there is any positive correlation between total hours sleep and sleep efficiency as both are a measurement of sleep quality. 
\newline
3. Explore and identify the optimize model upon conducting the iteration process. 
\newline
4. Implement a model with a similar feature with apple watch which emulates a non-invasive arm sensor (ACTG) and evaluate the model.

# Literature Review
Base on Naito et al (2021) studies, the quality of sleep does is highly correlated to the total sleep hours per day, typically between the range of 7-9 hours per day for best cognitive performance throughout the daytime.However, it is an oversimplification of associating sleep quality with total hours of sleep. Based on Alfonsi et al (2021) studies, the sample had an increase of total sleep time by 31 minutes during the pandemic. Although the increase of sleeping time should have improved sleep quality, it was found that it does not extend towards the equivalent of sleeping more. Creating an illusion that the participants sleep more but does not have any cognitive performance improvement. Therefore, sleep efficiency was introduced as an alternate measurement metric to evaluate simultaneously with total sleeping hours. Despite evaluating sleep from a different perspective, it raises questions as to what factors could influence sleep efficiency. The contrast between Alfonsi et al (2021) & Okamura et al (2020) ;Hofer and Chen (2020) studies revolve around the sample. Alfonsi et al (2021) samples were collected during the pandemic, where every sample was experiencing high levels of stress. Whereas Okamura et al (2020) ;Hofer and Chen (2020) studies of sleep efficiency were revolving around happiness. Based on these research, the common characteristic found between these research was sleep latency. It was found that participants with higher levels of stress do associate with longer sleep latency and vice versa. Thus, it emphasizes that sleep duration metric alone provide an does not provide an accurate reflection of the participants sleep quality.
\newline

Meltzer et al (2005) studies focus on the comparison of a commercial PSG and non-invasive arm sensor (ACTG) accuracy in sleep measurement. The research found that the ACT (Fitbit Ultra Normal Mode) had performed well on sensitivity of 0.87 & accuracy of 0.84 but performed poorly on specificity of 0.52. While the ACT (Fitbit Ultra Sensitive Mode) performed well on specificity of 0.79 and scored lower for sensitivity of 0.70 & accuracy of 0.71 (Meltzer et al. 2005; Water et al. 2011). Although the inaccuracy was not ideal, the technology gap has significantly improved over the decade. Despite the discrepancy between PSG and Apple Watch, Apple Watch is continuously improving and has been recognised (approved by FDA) as evaluation tools for detecting irregular heart rate (John et al. 2022). The current literature review aims to explore a different set of various in regards to the connection with sleep efficiency.

**REM and Sleep Efficiency** 
Throughout the research, there is a lack of exploring the relationship between REM sleep and sleep efficiency. The research was conducted indirectly through the exploration of REM Sleep fragmentation influences emotional disturbance. Therefore the feature was selected to explore the significance in comparison with sleep efficiency (Djonlagic et al. 2020).
\newline

**Awakening and Sleep Efficiency**
Tsuchiya et al (2014) studies revolve around the mother experiencing fragmented sleep due to frequent feeding within the hospital. The studies found that the higher the feeding frequency, the lower the sleep efficiency.
\newline

**Deep & Light Sleep Percentage and Sleep Efficiency**
Onton et al (2018) research revolves around exploring sleep quality by measuring the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) between a control and Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) samples. It was found that the PTSD sample had scored significantly higher in terms of PSQI which reflected a decrease in sleep quality.
\newline

**Sleep Duration and Sleep Efficiency**
\newline
The studies of the correlation between total sleep hours and sleep quality (PSQI) was conducted on a large sample size of 18,631 by Sun et al. (2015). It was found that farmers had the highest mean for total hours slept which reflected the lowest PSQI score of 3.74. Although the studies do highlight that occupation does influence the PSQI to a certain extent, it emphasizes that the total hours slept had a positive correlation with the PSQI score.

## Data collection
A group of student from ENSIAS recruited participants from a local community in Morocco and collected the data over several months. The data was recorded by several methods which are self reported survey, actigraphy (ACT) and polysomnography (PSG).

# Research Methodology
## Methodology 

The project methodology involves applying SEMMA, a data mining process created by the SAS Institute (Matignon, 2007). SEMMA is an acronym representing the steps of Sampling, Exploring, Modifying, Modeling, and Assessing.

### Sampling
A subset of the population would be taken to represent and infer insight about the population concern. Based on Diwekar et al.2007 studies, sampling was implemented as a method for uncertainty analysis because it enables the quantification of different variables within the framework. 

### Explore
By utilizing R programming language, the explore phase objective would be to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data of the project. The explore phase plays a pivotal role by providing insights regarding the data distribution, variable correlation and key factors influencing the target variable. Moreover, it extends into formulating hypotheses and refining the subsequent modeling phases, ensuring a targeted and well-informed approach (Wickham & Grolemund, 2017). Univariate and bivariate analysis would be implemented to illustrate the data distribution and relationship amongst the dependent and dependent variable (James et al., 2013). Univariate analysis focuses on individual variables, it examines the variables in isolation which provide understanding regarding the data distribution and characteristics. Bivariate analysis explores the relationship between the dependent and dependent variables (Hair et al., 2018).

### Modify
Modifying in SEMMA focuses on data preprocessing. Data problems would be an underlying factor which could contribute to wrong prediction within any machine learning model (Dasu and Johnson, 2003). Although the focus on the studies revolve with regression analysis, resolving data problems such as missing data or duplicates would prove to be useful.


### Model
According to Bingham and Fry (2010) linear regression is the simplest model among the selection for regression models. The model enables simplification and is easy to interpret thereby indicating it would be a suitable baseline for comparison. The goal of the model phase would be to identify the best model by evaluating the linear model summary of the dataset. The insight would provide the level of significance between the independent and dependent variable.

### Analyze
To assess the performance of the models, the model will undergo several iteration processes until the best model is optimized. The method conducted would be by removing one dependent variable at the time. The removal process would be based on the significance of the dependent variable based on the linear model summary. The normality test would be implemented to reduce statistical error upon interpreting the result. Based on Ghasemi. and Zahediasl (2012) studies, sample size exceeding 30 would have an exception for not normally distribution due to the Central limit theorem.
